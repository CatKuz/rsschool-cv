<h3>Summary</h3><p>I'm a student of a second year at SPbETU 'LETI'. I was studying HTML and CSS in SPbSPU when I was younger, now my goal is to improve my knowledge and skills in those languages + JS. That's why I enrolled in RS' course.<br> I also studied manual testing, the basics of QA. It gave me a chance to practice and start my way in IT. I've been working a remote junior QA engineer for 4 month already and been working as an intern remotely. Besides, I was interviewed by a few companis (Veeam and Fora Soft). I did their test tasks. It also helped me to practice.<br> However, I'm more attracted to Frontend development, I have a good sense of composition and color (had painting classes for 6 years).<br> Moreover, I study Iformational Systems and Technologies at the University, where we have to code a lot (c++ mostly). I also was interested in Python, learened some basics with the help of courses in Russian first and then in English. So, coding + creative inclinations lead me to studying Frontend. I'm planning to try entering EPAM lab in ETU when I'm ready enough with my skills and knowledge. I think I'll do my best to make my dream come true.<br> I'm a fast learner, very purposeful (don't know anyone on my course in Uni who tried interviewing on a position in IT after the 1st year and was working so hard outside the doors of the University to get skills him(her)self). May sound a bit boastfully, but it's true. I know, Uni means a lot, but the most important is the ability to find information needed and perform tasks you never did before.<br></p>
<br><br>
<h3>Skills</h3><p>I'm feel myself quite confident in HTML and CSS. I had some course works in University. Also, I selfstudied Python in JetBrains Academy and Coursera (HSE course), can name myself intermediate in C++ which I study and use in University. On the top of that, I am aware of GIT, since I also used it in my 1st year in Uni while working with Bitbucket.
<h3>Code examples</h3><a href = "https://ekaterina_kuznetcova@bitbucket.org/trbogdanov/dictionary-9375.git">Bitbucket repo</a> (1st year Uni course work on 'Programming' subject)
<h3>Experience</h3>As I already mentioned my course work, I was working on it for 3 month. And my current occupation as junior mannual QA. I test releases on <a href = "https://about.meraxe.com/">meraxe</a>.
<h3>Education</h3>UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA (Coursera) 'English for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics', Academy of Informatics of SPbPU 'Web technologies'(offline), NRU HSE (Coursera) 'Fundamentals of Python Programming', Udemy 'Become a QA engineer'
<h3>English</h3>C1+ I study English for 10 years now and always continiously, sice I participated in Olympiades and contests. Also, I use it every day for studying (courses in taught in English), literature and work (I write for ITMO NEWS BLOG and rewrite articles concerning Microsoft technologies as a freelancer).</p>

3. I'm a student of a second year at **SPbETU 'LETI'**. I was studying HTML and CSS in SPbSPU when I was younger, now my goal is to improve my knowledge and skills in those languages + JS. That's why I enrolled in RS' course.
I also studied mannual testing, the basics of QA. It gave me a chance to practice and start my way in IT. I've been working a remote junior QA engineer for 4 month already. Besides, I was interviwed by a few companis (Veeam and Fora Soft). I did their test tasks. It also helped me to practice.
However, I'm more attracted to Frontend development, I have a good sense of composition and color (had painting classes for 6 years). Moreover, I study Iformational Systems and Technologies at the University, where we have to code a lot (c++ mostly). So, coding + creative inclinations lead me to studying Frontend.
I'm planning to try entering EPAM lab in ETU when I'm ready enough whith my skills and knowledge. I think I'll do my best to make my dream come true. I'm a fast learner, very purposeful (don't know anyone on my course in Uni who tried interviewing on a position in IT after the 1st year and was working so hard outside the doors of the University to get skills him(her)self).
May sound a bit boastfully, but it's true. 
5. I'm feel myself quite confident in HTML and CSS. I had some course works in University. Also, I selfstudied Python in JetBrains Academy and Coursera (HSE course), can name myself intermediate in C++ which I study and use in University. 
On the top of that, I am aware of GIT, sice I also used it in my 1st year in Uni while working with Bitbucket.
